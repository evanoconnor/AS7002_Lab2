The difficulty, as we have seen in class, is that Euler's equations are non-linear.

We will evolve the equation of a number of time steps $n_\\mathrm{step}$ with a $\\Delta t$ of $1/n_\\mathrm{step}$ so that after $n_\\mathrm{step}$ the time past is 1 unit and the wave should return back to its original location, and we can see how well we did.\n",

The quantity in the spatial derivative is the \"flux\" since it represents the flux (state variable * velocity; here we have taken $u$ outside the derivative, but that was because it is constant, in the Euler equations it shows up inside the derivative).  A first guess at this discretization might be the following, called FTCS.  This stands for Forward Time, Centered Space, it transforms the continuous differential equation,\n",

Unlike last lab, we are now doing it for `npoints`, so we really have `npoints` differential equations that we are solving. Another added complication is the differential equations are semicoupled, since the evolution of the $i$th density depends on the $i-1$ and $i+1$ density. Luckily, this method uses only densities at the $n$ time level, and not the $n+1$ time level, then we would need to solve the equations simutaneously, as it is here, we just need to know the full $n$ state everywhere to find the $n+1$ state locally.\n",

This concept will become more important when we go to solve the Euler equations and become concerned with conservation of things like mass, momentum, and energy.  In the case of upwinding, we take the flux at the interface $i+1/2$ to be either the flux evaluated at the cell center if cell $i$ or $i+1$, depending on the velocity.

The Riemann problem aims to determine the flux at the interface ($F_{i+1/2}$) through a potentially complicated function $\\mathcal{R}$ of the left and right fluxes (or more generally the left and right state variables).
